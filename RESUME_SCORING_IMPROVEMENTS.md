# Resume Scoring System - Improvements & Features

## 🎯 Overview
Enhanced the AI-powered resume scoring system with better accuracy, error handling, and user experience.

---

## ✅ Backend Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Scoring Algorithm** (`resume_scorer.py`)

#### Score Scale Fix
- **Before**: Returned 0-100 percentage score
- **After**: Returns 0-5.0 scale matching frontend expectations
- **Formula**: `cosine_similarity * 5.0`

#### Multi-Factor Scoring
```python
Base Score (TF-IDF Similarity)     → 0-5.0 scale
+ Skills Listed Bonus              → +0.3
+ Experience Listed Bonus          → +0.3
+ Education Listed Bonus           → +0.2
+ Skill Match Ratio               → +0.0 to +0.5
= Enhanced Final Score (capped at 5.0)
```

#### Error Handling
- File existence validation
- Empty file detection
- PDF extraction error handling
- Graceful fallback to 0.0 score

### 2. **Improved API Endpoint** (`applications/views.py`)

#### Features Added:
✅ **Permission Validation**: Verifies job belongs to the employer
✅ **Better Error Messages**: Detailed responses for debugging
✅ **Include All Applications**: Shows candidates even without resumes
✅ **Additional Metadata**: Returns phone, status, applied_date
✅ **Statistics**: Total, analyzed, and skipped counts
✅ **Job Context**: Returns job title and description

#### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "application_id": 1,
      "candidate": "username",
      "candidate_name": "Full Name",
      "email": "email@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "status": "pending",
      "applied_date": "2025-11-24",
      "score": 4.25,
      "parsed_data": {
        "entities": { /* skills, education, etc */ },
        "method": "fallback",
        "status": "success"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_applications": 10,
  "analyzed": 8,
  "skipped": 2,
  "job_title": "Senior Frontend Developer",
  "job_description": "..."
}
```

#### Authentication Check
- Validates token before API calls
- Redirects to login if needed

#### Detailed Toast Messages
- Success: Shows analyzed vs total count
- Info: No applications found
- Error: Specific error messages with context

#### Empty States
- Shows message when no applications exist
- Displays job title even with no candidates

### 3. **Improved Data Fetching**

#### Auto-Population
- Job description auto-loads for custom ranking
- Proper handling of paginated job lists

## 🔍 How the Scoring Works

### 1. **Text Extraction**
- Extracts text from PDF or TXT resumes
- Supports multiple file formats
- Handles encoding issues

### 2. **Entity Parsing**
Uses regex patterns to extract:
- 📧 Email addresses
- 📞 Phone numbers
- 👤 Names
- 💼 Technical skills (50+ keywords)
- 🎓 Education degrees
- 📊 Years of experience
- 🏢 Organizations

### 3. **TF-IDF Similarity**
- Converts resume and job description to TF-IDF vectors
- Computes cosine similarity
- Weights: Resume skills vs Job requirements

### 4. **Bonus Scoring**
Additional points for:
- Having skills section (+0.3)
- Having experience section (+0.3)
- Having education section (+0.2)
- Skill keyword matches (+0.0 to +0.5)

### 5. **Final Ranking**
- Sorts candidates by score (highest first)
- Displays ranking position
- Shows detailed breakdown
